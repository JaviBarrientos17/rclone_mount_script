3. Create a blank bat file or clone the project from github.

4. Add the following lines to the bat file:

The variable %MOUNT_NAME% is the name of the mount you have defined in your CLI.

The other variable %COMPUTER_DRIVE% is the letter that you want to assign to store your rclone mount. In windows, is defined by capital letters, for example, K.

6. Here you have to write "shell:startupshell:startup", to open the windows startup folder.
